## Data Structures

Data Structure is a way of collecting and organizing  data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have data player's name "Virat" and age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type.

 We can organize this data as a record like Player record. Now we can collect and store player's records in a file or database as a data structure. For example: "Dhoni" 30, "Gambhir" 31, "Sehwag" 33

Essentially, Data Structures are a way store and sometimes order data, so that various operations can be performed on it easily and efficiently. It should be designed and implemented in such a way as to reduces some complexity while making certain trade-offs that allow us to solve some problem.

<!-- Data Structures in memory-->
In Computer memory i.e RAM, different data structures are created like the Stack, Queue, Linked-list, Heaps, etc... according to the requirement of the program so as to use the memory efficiently and solve some problem at hand.
